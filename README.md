# Bangla_NEWS_NER
Repository regarding named entity recognition of Bangla data collected by scraping Bangla newspaper. 

## Installation

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dependency

|>data
* annotations.txt file refers to semi annotated data generated by pretrained model for named entity extraction.

|>utils
* semi_annotation_on_scraped_data_using_pretrained_model.py script for semi annotation of scraped data by pretrained model.
* custom_model_training_on_semi_annotated_data.py script for model training.
* custom_model_config_file_generation.py script for expected format generation of training configuration file, tokenizer and model file.

|>inference
* custom_model_inference.py script for trained model file testing on data.
* pretrained_model_inference.py script for pre-trained model file testing on data.

|>deployment
* news_entity_extraction_deploy_using_self_trained_custom_model.py script for web deployment and performance testing for trained model file.
* news_entity_extraction_deploy_using_pretrained_model.py script for web deployment and performance testing for pre-trained model file. 

## N.T.B: Custom trained model files could not be shared for large file system, LFS dependency.
